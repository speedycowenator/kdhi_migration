        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-8"><strong class="bold-text">The Korea Data History Initiative, or KDHI, is affiliated with the Korea Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). KDHI is dedicated in its mission to provide data-driven and historically-informed research of the Korean peninsula. <br><br>No individual - whether an academic, seasoned diplomat, intelligence analyst or policy practitioner - is the sole authority on understanding Korea; nor does anyone have the time to collect and methodize the massive volume of Korea-related information generated every day. Over the past 70 years, inaccurate information has disseminated and developed into accepted fact in both the academic and policy-making communities, steering the direction of foreign policy decisions. Therefore, KDHI was created to aggregate data north and south of the 38th parallel with data science technology and synthesize such data with the broader historical record and the academic frameworks of negotiation, economics, and geostrategy. <br><br>KDHI at Johns Hopkins SAIS provides primary source data - ranging from our North Korea State Media Archive to official document collections curated from depositories around the world - and produces rigorously researched policy briefings on the two Koreas. KDHI also presents up-to-date leadership charts and biographies across the party and technocratic spectrum via open-source intelligence (OSINT). Research of the peninsula&#x27;s leadership is accompanied by maps and profiles of the two Korea&#x27;s political and economic institutions, revealing how Pyongyang and Seoul&#x27;s various government organs work to craft and execute each country&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies.<br><br>KDHI at Johns Hopkins SAIS designs its research and analysis to be digestible for policymakers, academics, and anyone interested in learning about Korea.</strong><br></p>
