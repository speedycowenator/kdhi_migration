            <h1 class="article">Ministry of Unification Unification Spending Did Not Burgeon amid Greater Cooperation with the North</h1>
            <p class="spending-main-paragraph">The Republic of Korea (ROK) spent $275 million USD on unification expenses in 2018, according to the Ministry of Unification (MOU). Around $50 million was allocated to MOU operations and staffing; Another $100 million supported North Korean defectors living in the South. Another $40 million went to education and capacity building within the South, which collectively lowers the sum potentially spent on actual inter-Korean activities to a fraction of the original sum. MOU’s accounting belies the much lower amount spent directly by the current administration on exchanges and initiatives with North Korea. <br><br>Accounting for the above line items, the MOU 2018 budget lists a total of $4.6 million spent on the Inter-Korean summits, Kaesong expenses, and a small number of assorted costs. The figures for engaging North Korea diplomatically are comparatively small given the $800 million price tag on the full Terminal High Altitude Defense (THAAD) battery costs the ROK spends to defend itself from potential threats.  <br><br>International observers critical of ROK President Moon Jae-in’s engagement with the North argue funds spent on North Korea fund Kim Jong Un’s regime. The majority of &quot;Inter-Korean Summits&quot; costs were likely incurred within the ROK, but it is also safe to assume a portion of the $2.1 million spent on summits ended up in the North without exemption approval from the UN’s 1718 Committee. Also, it’s difficult to account for monetized gifts exchanged privately between North and South Koreans in Pyongyang. The $8.6 million spent on opening the inter-Korean Joint Liaison Office also more likely included funds and items landing in North Korea without UN approval. However, any potential fraction of the summit items and liaison office expenditures pale in comparison to the $71.6 million invested into the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund.</p>

            <h1 class="article">Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund: Opaque Project Spending &amp; Accounting</h1>
            <p class="spending-main-paragraph">MOU’s official budget sheet includes funding for Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, an opaque financial pool source the ROK taps for inter-Korean expenses. 2018’s spending is considerably less than the average yearly allocation and is down $10 million from last year. The fund’s total<br>reserves run around $9 billion dollars.<br><br>Think tank estimates of the Fund&#x27;s total size, however, are overblown as they count both the Fund&#x27;s liquid and non-liquid - itemized as‘investment’ - assets. The ROK uses the &#x27;investment&#x27; asset category to balance its books against the massive, un-repaid grants, loans, and assistance it has given the DPRK. (Note: The fund’s largest assistance is KEDO - Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization - in which the DPRK will never repay. EndNote.) The Fund’s liquid assets are around $3 billion USD; $6 billion USD of the assets are liquid. <br><br>The ROK’s executive branch can spend the fund’s liquid assets on projects as it sees fit; legislative authority mandating accountability via reporting and itemizing expenses is almost entirely lacking.The executive branch previously under presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun also induced investment in North Korea via grants, subsidies, and guaranteed loans at low interest rates to South Korean companies who wish to buy into the Sunshine policy and venture in North Korea’s business environment (Note:Hyundai paid North Korea $500 million USD to North Korea under this policy to hold first inter-Korean leadership summit in 2000. End Note.). The policy provides government-sponsored insurance for companies to recoup losses. South Korea does not report private investment numbers in connection to the policy.<br><br>President Moon was Roh Moo-hyun’s chief of staff when the policy was supercharged in opening the Kaesong Industrial Complex and Mount Kumgang Resort area. This policy cannot be at its mid-2000s levels undercurrent sanctions conditions. However, Moon is a long supporter of this policy and it is safe to assume private investment has been used in current inter-Korean projects. Although KDHI continues to investigate, an estimation of aggregate private spending in 2018 will not be provided at this time.<br><br>Therefore, a full accounting of the ROK&#x27;s inter-Korean expenses is imprecise and incredibly difficult to audit. KDHI does maintain an ongoing estimation of the total Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund spending. For the sake of clarity and precision, KDHI&#x27;s itemized report only includes the MOU’s official budget, as reported to the ROK legislature at the end of 2018.</p>

            <h1 class="article">Itemized Unification Expenses</h1>
            <p class="spending-main-paragraph">The ROK government directed the majority of Ministry of Unification towards North Korean defector (NKD) support programs for a total of$110,997 ,000. Expenses fund support programs for defectors who arrive in the ROK, helping NKDs to adjust to life in the South and learn the skills they need to survive on their own in a radically different society. Some NKD programs include protection during their trip to South Korea, housing in a Hanawon Settlement Support Center, and providing critical healthcare.<br><br>Other itemized expenses focused primarily on education and administrative costs incurred by standard MOU operation. MOU spends a substantial amount of money every year maintaining its North Korean Analysis arm, which is partially available to the public as open-source outlet of DPRK information. KDHI has provided the MOU&#x27;s itemized list of project expenses in the table below, as well as the same figures for the 2016 and 2017 budgets:</p>
