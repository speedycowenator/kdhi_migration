75678,Crime of Japanese Imperialists Who Fabricated,  Japanese imperialists fabricated the Korea-Japan Protocol on Feb. 23 1904. The Korea-Japan Protocol clearly proves that the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea was a brazen-faced and brigandish act. The fabrication of the protocol was a part of the preparations of the Japanese imperialists to occupy Korea by force of arms and totally colonize it. The Japanese imperialists fabricated the aggressive protocol after occupying the whole of Korea by force of arms. The protocol was the brigandish product of the Japanese imperialists' persistent violence. It is clearly evidenced by the threat and blackmail kidnapping and detention of the supreme ruler and high-ranking officials of the feudal government of Korea. The protocol was an aggressive document that provided a legal guarantee to occupy Korea by force of arms under the pretext of 'œprotection'. The Japanese imperialists talking about the 'œpeace on the Orient' and 'œindependence of Korea and preservation of its territory' in the protocol tried to cover up their aggressive nature. But it is very self-evident that their act was aimed to impose heavy burdens for war upon the Korean people while using Korea as a theater of aggressive war and to lay the foundation for monopolizing it as their total colony. The Japanese imperialists fabricated the 'œUlsa(1905) Five-point Treaty' and the 'œKorea-Japan Annexation Treaty' in 1910 in a brigandish manner and thus annexed the territory of Korea to them. The hideous crimes of the Japanese imperialists who forced the Korean people into all unequal treaties and mercilessly seized the sovereignty of Korea will certainly face the stern judgment of history.,Pak Song Yong,2/25/2020

The ^Korea-Japan Protocol^ clearly proves that the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea was a brazen-faced and brigandish act** the article says** and goes on:The fabrication of the protocol was a part of the preparations of the Japanese imperialists to occupy Korea by force of arms and totally colonize it. The Japanese imperialists fabricated the aggressive protocol after occupying the whole of Korea by force of arms. The protocol was the brigandish product of the Japanese imperialists' persistent violence. It is clearly evidenced by the threat and blackmail** kidnapping and detention of the supreme ruler and high-ranking officials of the feudal government of Korea. The protocol was an aggressive document that provided a legal guarantee to occupy Korea by force of arms under the pretext of ^protection^. The Japanese imperialists** talking about the ^peace on the Orient^ and ^independence of Korea and preservation of its territory^ in the protocol** tried to cover up their aggressive nature. But it is very self-evident that their act was aimed to impose heavy burdens for war upon the Korean people while using Korea as a theater of aggressive war and to lay the foundation for monopolizing it as their total colony. The Japanese imperialists fabricated the ^Ulsa (1905) Five-point Treaty^ and the ^Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty^ in 1910 in a brigandish manner and thus annexed the territory of Korea to them. The hideous crimes of the Japanese imperialists who forced the Korean people into all unequal treaties and mercilessly seized the sovereignty of Korea will certainly face the stern judgment of history.,KCNA,2/24/2020

75448,Greedy Power Seeker Hwang Kyo An Hit for Tricky ^Innovation^ Farce,Pyongyang** February 6 (KCNA) -- Representative of the ^Liberal Korea Party^ Hwang Kyo An is getting ever more undisguised in his ambition for power with the approach of the election of ^assemblymen^ in south Korea. He is engaged in high-handed and arbitrary practice by claiming that he would win an overwhelming victory in the election by replacing half of the incumbent lawmakers of the party with new ones and admitting diplomacy and security experts and university professors into the party on the plea of ^accession of talents^ only to add to the complaints of the party members. Such a farce stepped up under the signboard of ^innovation^ is the revelation of his impure intention to lay the foundation for seizure of power by ^improving the dirty image of the LKP^. Worse still** it is a cunning political trick to eliminate his political rivals within the party** nominate his close associates as general election candidates and hold party hegemony so as to establish the one-man system. Traitor Hwang worked as minister of Justice** ^prime minister^ and acting ^president^ under the Park Geun Hye regime. He is openly laying bare his wild ambition for the ^presidency^. He** obsessed by a filthy ambition** became the representative of the LKP through transformation and intrigues** but his position in the party is weakened with each passing day. In less than a year since he held the party hegemony he desperately tried to solidify his footing by expelling pro-Park Geun Hye group under the signboard of ^innovation of the party^ and dealt every matter with high-handedness in disregard of ^elders^. Hwang with poor quality and personality who has no political foundation is branded as ^a guest^** ^an inexperienced politician^** ^an amateur^ and ^an idiot^ by the pro-Park Geun Hye group** though. The upcoming general election is a golden opportunity for him to pave the way for the next ^presidency^. To this end he is staging the ^innovation^ farce designed to replace the incumbent lawmakers with his close associates and remove his rivals in the party** inviting a strong backlash from within the party and driving him into a tight corner. Leading lawmakers in the party who were threatened to be excluded from the nomination for the ^National Assembly^ unless they run in the constituency with difficulties to win argue that the threat is a ^showy act harmful to the party^. And the incumbent lawmakers in Taegu and North Kyongsang Province who are exposed to ^50 percent replacement^ say that all the lawmakers in the regions will not remain a passive onlooker to the replacement. Some party members contend that Hwang Kyo An whose term of party membership is less than one year is running the show. He can never cover up his dirty ambition for power however loudly he may clamor for ^innovation^ and ^merger^. Traitor Hwang is a criminal who has earned ill fame as fascist dictator** traitor to the nation and human scum. It is a tragedy for the south Korean people that the traitor who should have been thrown into the ditch of history still seeks power.,KCNA,2/7/2020

75298,Past Crimes Committed by Japan to Obliterate Spirit of Korean Nation,In the last century Japan committed crimes of burning up many precious national classics of Korea. After their illegal occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists conducted an 'œinvestigation' into the books inspiring patriotic spirit of the Korean nation and captured and threw them into the fire at random. Under the pretext of 'œdata collection' they had impelled their military police police and government officials to confiscate the classics form private schools Buddhist temples Confucian schools and others across Korea during the period of 1910 to 1918. After all more than 200 000 volumes of classics were reduced to ashes. Besides the Japanese imperialists arrested and imprisoned the Koreans who hid the historical books or read them secretly. In the 1920s they framed a sinister plot called edition of 'œKorean History Book'. They organized a 'œcommittee for compilation of Korean history book' on the 'œinstruction of government-general in Korea' No. 64 in December 1922 to work out a plan for plundering historical data and pushed ahead with the capture of Korean national classics. Four years later they removed all data except some needed for distorting the history. When they were expelled from Korea they let paid historians burn up documents of the 'œSociety of Compilation of Korean History Book' and many other data related to the Korean history. Due to such vicious obliteration by the Japanese imperialists the national classics of Korea were almost eliminated before its liberation. Lurking behind such deeds was a cruel aim of the Japanese imperialists to obliterate the national pride of the Koreans and assimilate them to the Japanese. History has never known such heinous robber as Japan which destroyed plundered and burnt up even national cultural heritages in a bid to obliterate the soul and identity of a nation.,Rodong Sinmun,1/23/2020

75300,Poisoning Case That Can Never Be Covered up,The Japanese imperialists committed the thrice-cursed atrocious act of poisoning Emperor Kojong on January 22 1919. The Japanese imperialists murdered Emperor Kojong by poison as he had taken the stand against them by taking the advantages of the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Korean people protesting against their occupation of Korea. It was the most unpardonable heinous crime. Though much water has flown under the bridge since the incident the truth behind it and Japan's atrocity and barbarity can never be covered up. Now Japan is sharpening the sword for reinvasion while distorting and whitewashing its history of aggression far from honestly reflecting on the past crimes and making an apology and reparation to the Korean people for its past crimes. As long as Japan takes the negative attitude toward the settlement of the past stronger will be the protest and denunciation by the Korean nation and the international community.,Kim Su Jin,1/23/2020

75272,Individualism Hotbed of Every Social Evil in Capitalist Society,Individualism is a reactionary idea to satisfy one's own desire by sacrificing not only the public interests but also the other's. Individualism serves as the principle of people's thinking and action and the principle of political activities of a reactionary state as well as the principle of activities of anti-popular social forces and political groups in capitalist society. Individualism is a source of all social evils in capitalist society. Individualism with which one ruthlessly tramples down reason morality conscience and obligation for one's own comfort and pleasure and seeks one's own interests by sacrificing the other produces all social evils such as murder robbery and fraud. Disillusion political distrust and hatred based on the extreme individualism are rampant in the capitalist society. It is the self-evident truth that there is no future for the capitalist society where man is neither respected nor valued and individualism encouraging selfish interests is prevalent. True human relations can never be formed and the sound development of society cannot be made in capitalist society where individualism is prevalent.,Kim Sung Gol,1/21/2020
75273,Wretched Plight of Working People in Capitalist Countries Can Never Be Changed,Science and technology develop in the capitalist society but its predatory nature cannot be changed and such incurable diseases as gap between the rich and the poor and unemployment can never be cured. The state power and means of production of the capitalist countries are under the control of business giants. It is clear that the demands of working people cannot be met in the capitalist society in spite of the development of IT industry. The development of IT industry in the capitalist society makes the rich get ever richer and the poor ever poorer and the settlement of unemployment more difficult. It's not because production doesn't meet the material needs that the working people live in poverty in the capitalist society. The greed of the capitalists and boundless exploitation by them make it impossible for the working people with limited solvency to buy goods however many products are turned out. In the capitalist society the development of science and technology and productive forces provides the capitalists with conditions for intensified exploitation of the working people. In the capitalist society dominated by a tiny handful of moneyed quarters the development of science and technology and productive forces plunges broad segments of working people into a more miserable position.,Ri Hak Nam,1/21/2020

75266,Newly Arranged Egg-boiling Site,One day in October 2018 Supreme Leader Kim Jog Un visited the Yangdok Hot-spring Resort under construction. He studied a general blueprint for the construction of the resort and got firsthand knowledge of in what numerous ways buildings were to be arranged there. He stressed that all the best things of the world must be consulted to ensure the highest level of their aesthetics and convenience. He then proceeded to make for a hot spring. For a while he saw water gushing from a hole in the spring. He said that it was to be drunk by the people and suggested to the officials that they taste it before anybody else. He was the first to be served with a cup of hot spring water and taste it. Soon afterwards he dipped his hand in the spring water although it was more than 80\xe2\x84\x83. He said with a broad smile that it was hot enough to be able to boil eggs. This played upon the heartstrings of the officials. When he visited the resort for the first time two months ago he inquired about the output of its hot springs and the temperature of their water. He abruptly asked if eggs could be boiled in the water because it was 80\xe2\x84\x83. When he came to a hole in a hot spring he said that he learned that eggs could be half done in the hole by its water in about half an hour and added with great satisfaction that hot springs of this sort were really worthy of their name. Today he guessed the temperature of the spring water by hand and was delighted again to say that eggs could be boiled in it. But the officials had so far failed to understand why Kim Jong Un mentioned eggs time and again. Looking round the construction site of the resort he gave precious instructions as to its building for a long time. He suddenly proposed going to a hole in a hot spring and boiling eggs in its water. He said that he felt really all right today and was truly pleased to think that the people could be presented with a good hot-spring resort. He again approached the hole. He closely watched an accompanying official putting eggs in its hot spring water with care. He asked an officer of the Korean People's Army in what minutes they could be done. He replied that 17 minutes did on trial. Kim Jong Un proposed to boil eggs in spring water for 20 minutes referring to his wrist watch. He sat on a plain chair near the hole in the spring and waited for eggs to be boiled. He apparently regarded it as most valuable to dedicate his time to the happiness of the people. The officials were infinitely touched to the heart. Kim Jong Un said warmly:'œThis hole should apparently be designated as a place for boiling eggs. The people will be delighted with it. 'A year passed from then on. When the construction of the resort was near completion Kim Jong Un visited it. Unlike everyone else he thought of choosing a place for boiling eggs and even arranged for the hole in the hot spring to be fitted up with a closet for flavorings for boiled eggs close-by. Consequently the place was brought into being anew in the resort.,Jong Yong Chol,1/20/2020

75211,Statement Issued by Advisor of DPRK Foreign Ministry,Pyongyang** January 11 (KCNA) -- Kim Kye Gwan** advisor of the DPRK Foreign Ministry** issued the following statement on Saturday:From the outset of this year** the south Korean authorities have become too busy** talking about urgent conveying of the U. S. president's birthday greetings to the Chairman of our State Affairs Commission. This is what the U. S. president asked for to be surely conveyed to the Chairman when he met the person concerned of Chongwadae in Washington** the south Korean authorities said in an extremely urgent notice they sent. But they seem not to know that there is a special liaison channel between the top leaders of the DPRK and the U. S. The birthday greetings from the U. S. president that reached us by care of the excited south Korean authorities through the notice is what we already got through the personal letter of the U. S. president. South Korea** not a member of the U. S. clan** went so frivolous as to convey the greetings from the U. S. president. It seems it still has lingering hope for playing the role of ^mediator^ in the DPRK-U. S. relations. To forge personal relations between heads of state is a diplomatically natural thing between states. However** it is somehow presumptuous for south Korea to meddle in the personal relations between Chairman of the State Affairs Commission ''Kim Jong Un and President Trump. As acknowledged by the world** it is true that the personal relations between the Chairman of our State Affairs Commission and President Trump are not bad. But** it is absentminded to think of either making us return to the dialogue with the U. S. by taking the advantage of such relations or creating an atmosphere for it. We have been deceived by the U. S. ** being caught in the dialogue with it for over one year and a half** and that was the lost time for us. Although Chairman ''Kim Jong Un has a good personal feelings about President Trump** they are** in the true sense of the word** ^personal^. The Chairman of the State Affairs Commission would not discuss the state affairs on the basis of such personal feelings** as he represents our state and its interests. What is clear is that we will never lose our time again** being taken in by the U. S. trick as in the past. There will never be such negotiations as that in Vietnam** in which we proposed exchanging a core nuclear facility of the country for the lift of some UN sanctions in a bid to lessen the sufferings of the peaceable people even a bit. There is no need for us to be present in such talks** in which there is only unilateral pressure** and we have no desire to barter something for other thing at the talks like traders. It can be said that the reopening of dialogue between the DPRK and the U. S. may be possible only under the condition of the latter's absolute agreement on the issues raised by the former** but we know well that the U. S. is neither ready nor able to do so. We know well about the way we should go and will go on our way. Under these circumstances** the south Korean authorities had better not dream a fabulous dream that we would return to the dialogue with thankful feelings for the birthday greetings like someone. They are well advised to behave prudently not to be reduced to a fool heading nowhere.,KCNA,1/11/2020

75204,Japan's Past Crime Viewed through 'œHansong Treaty',Japan used all sorts of schemes to threaten and blackmail the Korean feudal government into signing 'œHansong Treaty' on January 9 1885. Just like 'œKanghwa Island Treaty' and 'œJemulpho Treaty' that the Korean feudal government signed in the latter half of the 19th century under the coercion by Japan 'œHansong Treaty' was also an unequal treaty that helped Japan pave the way for crudely violating the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and further strengthening aggression of Korea. The process of fabricating 'œHansong Treaty' proved the Japanese imperialists' craftiness viciousness and aggressive nature. The Japanese imperialists made up illegal criminal documents one after another in such a brigandish way and finally reduced Korea to their colony. For over 40 years since the Japanese imperialists' illegal occupation of Korea they enforced harsh colonial rule and forced the Korean people to live the life of slaves and took away massive human and material resources from Korea. They are indeed the sworn enemy of the Korean people. The Japanese authorities are still resorting to all sorts of sleight of hand to evade the responsibility for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past far from making sincere repentance for those crimes. History can neither be erased nor distorted. Japan has to make an apology and reparation for the crimes against the Korean nation. It has to remember that the more desperately it tries to evade the state responsibility for those crimes the deeper it will find itself falling into a pitfall and the greater the Korean people's revenge on it will be.,Ra Myong Song,1/10/2020

75182,Reactionary Nature of Capitalist System Cannot Be Concealed,Societies that had existed before capitalism were all unequal but capitalism is the worst ever that surpasses all of them. In capitalist society the privileged accounting for 1 percent of population holds all the power and wealth and oppresses and exploits all strata of people of 99 percent. In the socio-class point of view the foundation of socialism is people while that of capitalism is the capitalist class. It is obvious that capitalism based on a tiny handful of 1 percent will collapse if the absolute majority of 99 percent vent their hatred and anger. As capitalism reaches the red line the mammonistic plutocrats as well as the ruling circles of the western countries are trembling with anxiety and fear. The ruling circles and monopolistic plutocrats in the western countries upset by their wavering domination and privileged position are resorting to all kinds of trickeries to ease the extreme socio-political contradiction even a bit. But such a camouflage can neither cover up nor ease the socio-political contradiction and confrontation of capitalism. Capitalism can never hide its nature as a reactionary society that goes against the desire and intrinsic requirements of the popular masses however hard it disguises itself. Society with its back turned on the public sentiment is doomed to ruin.,Ri Kyong Su,1/7/2020

The head-on breakthrough at present is a revolutionary offensive to surmount the subjective and objective obstacles and difficulties in the advance of the Korean revolution and open up a new avenue for the socialist construction. The main obstacle stemming the advance of our revolution today is the moves of the hostile forces to stifle the DPRK. Despite its lip-service for dialogue the U. S. is getting undisguised in its political military and economic designs to strangle and stifle the DPRK. Now is a crucial and pivotal time to make our military and technical power irreversible and to steadily push forward the development of strategic weapons indispensable and prerequisite for the security of the country until the U. S. withdrawal of its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the establishment of lasting and durable peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula and thus firmly guarantee the security and dignity of the country and the building of a powerful country militarily. We have already made great achievements in augmenting our own driving force with self-support and self-sustenance as the motive force but there are not a few problems that should be set right in the state management economic work and other fields in order to further expanding and developing those achievements. Based on the comprehensive and in-depth analysis and assessment of the domestic and international situation of the Korean revolution our Party clarified the revolution line on waging a breakthrough head-on to further expedite the socialist construction at the recent plenary meeting. The present head-on breakthrough is also an offensive on the initiatives to remove the root cause of the challenges and obstacles to our advance and guarantee the steady advance and development of the Korean revolution. The best way of reducing to submission the imperialists regarding the power as al-mighty is to possess the maximum power to neutralize the offensive of the enemies to stifle the DPRK.,Kim Yong Il,1/7/2020
75184,To Further Strengthen Our Own Internal Might Is the Requirement of Present Situation and Developing Revolution,To strengthen in every way our own force is an important demand to be constantly held fast to in the socialist construction. A decisive factor of the victory of the revolution lies in how to strengthen the revolutionary force and raise its role not in objective conditions. When our own force is strong it is possible to carry out any difficult and vast historic tasks and firmly defend and further develop our own style socialism. This is a historic review of our protracted revolution. In general the future of our revolution is optimistic but grave subjective and objective obstacles and difficulties exist in actual fact. To further strengthen our own force first of all is an urgent demand of the present situation in which a protracted confrontation with the U. S. has become a fait accompli. It is also related to a series of faults and deviations existing in our work. Today our revolution has come to a historic turning point for hastening a new victory in building a powerful socialist country. When all officials inquire into the portions their sectors and units contributed to building a powerful socialist country under the present situation have a readiness to shoulder the heavy tasks and accomplish them without despair and vacillation our political and ideological might and the power of our self-supporting economy would grow stronger as never before and the advantages of our system be fully displayed.,Hong Jin Hyok,1/7/2020

75176,Editorial, The Workers' Party of Korea is the great guardian of the nation and the most seasoned and experienced guide of the present times as it turned the DPRK once eclipsed on the global map into a powerful country recognized by the world and cultivated a strength strong enough to guarantee dignity and prosperity for all generations to come in a brief span of history. It is the unanimous desire and revolutionary will of all the people to splendidly celebrate the founding anniversary of the ever-victorious WPK with resounding victory to be specially recorded in the history of the country. We have our style of powerful fighting strategy to take greater steps in the revolutionary advance in this meaningful year. The line of launching an offensive for making a breakthrough head-on determined by the Party is a revolutionary fighting strategy and way of advance with which to take the initiative and flexibly turn difficulties to good account. The offensive for making a breakthrough head-on is the only way to make the country's high strategic position and marked trend of growth irreversible and to usher in a period of upsurge in socialist construction. Now the hostile forces are making a last-ditch effort. The more we strengthen in every way our own force the internal motive force in all the aspects of the offensive for making a breakthrough head-on and create valuable wealth on the strength of self-reliance and self-sufficiency the greater agony the enemies will suffer and the earlier the day of victory of socialism will come.,Let us overcome the difficulties with the indomitable revolutionary faith ardent patriotism and indefatigable fighting spirit under the leadership of the great Party and to win signal victories stunning the world under the banner of achieving prosperity by dint of selfreliance in this meaningful year marking the 75th founding anniversary of the WPK. ,1/6/2020
75177,Basic Idea and Spirit of 5th Plenary Meeting of 7th C. C. WPK,The basic idea the basic spirit of the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) is to conduct the offensive for a breakthrough head-on not to wait for the situation to turn better. In other words we should never dream that the U. S. and other hostile forces would leave us to live in peace but make a breakthrough head-on on the strength of self-reliance to tide over the difficulties lying in the way of advance of our socialist construction. The basic idea the basic spirit of the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the WPK reflects the truth and lessons of history that illusions about the enemy and peace and the lingering expectation for the lift of sanctions are a taboo and embodies the iron truth of the revolution that only offensive on one's own initiative not the passive defense can turn adversity into favorable situation. It also reflects the requirement to strengthen our internal strength in all aspects and overcome difficulties with the might of self-reliance. As a leopard cannot change its spots the aggressive nature of imperialism can never change. So is the U. S. behavior today. The real intention of the U. S. is to seek its own political and diplomatic interests while wasting time away under the signboard of dialogue and negotiations and at the same time keep sanctions so as to gradually reduce our strength. The reality shows that now that the ambition of the enemy to stifle our system remains unchanged it is foolish to dream of the ease of situation and the lift of sanctions. The plenary meeting took accurate and audacious measures on the basis of a cool-headed judgment of the prevailing external situation. The plenary meeting reflects the firm will of our Party to eliminate all the challenges and barriers to our advance with another dynamic offensive and hasten the victory of a drive for building a powerful socialist country. Every field and unit should break through head-on all the barriers to our advance holding aloft the slogan of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Herein lies the way to glorify this significant year marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Party as the one noteworthy in the history of building our Party and a powerful state of independence.,Jo Hak Chol,1/6/2020

75143,Report on 5th Plenary Meeting of 7th C. C. WPK,"The 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea was held at the headquarters building of the WPK Central Committee from December 28 to 31 Juche 108 (2019). Kim Jong Un chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea guided the plenary meeting. Attending the meeting were members and alternate members of the C. C. WPK and members of the Central Auditing Commission of the WPK. Present as observers were officials of the WPK Central Committee officials of ministries and national institutions chairpersons of the provincial people's committees chairpersons of the provincial rural economy committees chairpersons of the city and county party committees and officials of major fields and units and the armed forces organs. Kim Jong Un presided over the meeting upon authorization of the Political Bureau of the C. C. WPK. The plenary meeting dealt with the following agenda items:1. On the orientation of our immediate struggle under the present internal and external situation2. On an organizational matter3. On modifying and supplementing the collection of the slogans set forth by the Party Central Committee4. On celebrating the 75th founding anniversary of the WPK with splendor. The first agenda was discussed. Kim Jong Un made a report on the first agenda. Saying that the period of the past eight months since the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK was a continuity of great intensified struggle and courageous advance he referred to the fact that the WPK has always established and maintained correct internal and external political lines centered on the urgent demand rights and interests of our people and the sovereignty and security of the state and has constantly struggled for them. He noted that the Party Central Committee convened the present plenary meeting for the purport of comprehensively and deeply analyzing and assessing the subjective and objective obstacles and difficulties faced in the course of the great and dynamic advance of our revolution and of taking a decisive measure for further promoting the socialist construction. Kim Jong Un advanced the revolutionary line on launching an offensive for frontal breakthrough as required by the present situation and the developing revolution. Noting that our Juche-based might with self-sufficiency and self-reliance as the motive power has been further strengthened in the tense struggle for carrying out the decision of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK he referred to the fact that our state and people greatly demonstrated the strong spirit and tremendous potentiality while proudly advancing and leaping in the difficult situation true to the appeal of the Party to open up a great period of surge in the socialist construction under the uplifted banner of self-reliance. He said that the challenges faced by us for the past several months were harsh and dangerous which others would not withstand even a single day but give up but no difficulties can ever stop or delay the rush of our people advancing as an integral whole undaunted by whatever hardships. He added that great successes have ceaselessly been made in bolstering up the strength of the state and in increasing defence capabilities. He noted that the huge and complicated work of developing the ultra-modern weapon system possessed only by the countries with advanced defence science and technology presupposed our own innovative solution in terms of the scientific and technical aspect without anyone's help and all the research tasks were perfectly carried out by the driving force i. e. our reliable scientists designers and workers in the field of the munitions industry. This means a great victory and our possession of promising strategic weapon system planned by the Party one by one serves as a great event in developing the armed forces of the Republic and defending and guaranteeing our sovereignty and right to existence he noted. He stressed that such a leap in developing the ultra-modern national defence science would make our great military and technical power irreversible greatly promote the increase of our great national power raise the power of putting the political situation around us under control and give the enemies the blow of big uneasiness and horror. In the future the more the U. S. stalls for time and hesitates in the settlement of the DPRK-U. S. relations the more helpless it will find itself before the might of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea getting stronger beyond prediction and the deeper it will fall into an impasse he noted. He referred to a series of successes achieved in the economic construction. Analyzing the trend of the prevailing present situation he said the U. S. real intention is to seek its own political and diplomatic interests while wasting time away under the signboard of dialogue and negotiations and at the same time keep sanctions upon the latter so as to weaken the latter. He stressed that we further hardened our resolution never to barter the security and dignity of the state and the safety of its future for anything else. He said that the stalemate between the DPRK and the U. S. can not but assume protracted nature as the U. S. is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude. He added that recently the U. S. is talking about continued dialogue while peddling the issue of the resumption of the dialogue here and there but this is just aimed to pass without trouble the year-end time-limit set by us and stall for the time for evading a lethal attack as it now finds itself in a tight corner not out of the intention to withdraw the hostile policy toward the DPRK and solve issues through improved relations. On the other hand the U. S. has openly revealed its provocative political military and economic maneuvers to completely strangle and stifle the DPRK. This is the double-dealing behavior of the brigandish U. S. he added. He said that we will never allow the impudent U. S. to abuse the DPRK-U. S. dialogue for meeting its sordid aim but will shift to a shocking actual action to make it pay for the pains sustained by our people so far and for the development so far restrained. He continued:It is true that we urgently need external environment favorable for the economic construction but we can never sell our dignity which we have so far defended as valuable as our own life in hope for brilliant transformation. The DPRK-U. S. stand-off which has lasted century after century has now been compressed to clear stand-off between self-reliance and sanctions. If there were not the nuclear issue the U. S. would find fault with us under other issue and the U. S. military and political threats would not end. The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U. S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future too and to strengthen the internal power from all aspects. He said there are not a few problems that need to be set right in state management economy and other fields from the viewpoint of strengthening our might. He analyzed the present situation including state management and economic performance which are insufficient for pulling and spurring the great cause of self-reliance and self-development and which fail to bring about a bold renovation but stay stagnant. The victory of the revolution is inevitable but it is not achieved without any difficulties and hardships he said and continues:If we do not put spur to the struggle for bolstering the power for self-development while waiting for the lift of sanctions the enemies' reactionary offensive will get fiercer to check our advance. The more we bolster our own strength and create valuable wealth on the strength of self-reliance and self-sufficiency the deeper the enemies will be driven into greater agony and the earlier the day of the victory of socialism will come. All the Party organizations and officials have to shoulder upon themselves the important duties entrusted to them by the times and turn out in the offensive for frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies' sanctions and blockade by dint of self-reliance. ""Let Us Break through Head-on All the Barriers to Our Advance!"" - this is the fighting slogan the entire Party and all the people should put up today. The key front in the offensive for frontal breakthrough today is economic front he said setting forth it as an immediate task for the economic field at present to rearrange the economic foundation of the country and fully tap all the possible production potential and to fully meet the demand needed for the economic development and people's life. He advanced important tasks for putting in order the economic work system and order. He set forth the fundamental ways for strengthening the Cabinet responsibility system Cabinet center system as the Cabinet is the nucleus of the state economic work system. He advanced crucial issues in finding out the correct way for improving the planning to meet the actual requirements keeping the overall balance between production and supply and decisively raising the confidence of the national economic plan. Emphasizing that the Cabinet work is precisely the work of the Party Central Committee and the execution of the decision of the Party Central Committee is the Cabinet work he made an anatomical analysis of the serious issues that need urgent solution in strengthening the state unified guidance and management of the economic work after the plenary meeting. After setting forth the innovative measures and detailed plans for adjusting the overall state machinery to spur the economic development and to enhance the role of officials he specified realistic ways for pushing forward the improvement of economic management based on them.

He made the overall analysis of the evil practices and stagnation found in metal chemical power coal machine and building materials industrial fields railway transport and light industrial field and set forth one by one scientific and substantial measures to bring about a giant stride forward in the economic work. He said that we have to correctly set up index-wise plans of ten long-term goals through scientific calculation to develop the country's economy on a stable and long-term basis and consolidate one by one the economic foundation of the country through the struggle to carry them out. He stressed the need to drastically increase the agricultural production. He called for improving science education and public health.

He called for dynamically conducting the movement for increased production ensuring economy and raising quality and protecting ecological environment and taking thorough-going measures for preventing natural disasters. He called for guaranteeing the offensive for frontal breakthrough politically diplomatically and militarily. There have to be powerful political diplomatic and military guarantee for sure victory in the offensive for frontal breakthrough to brave unprecedented harsh challenge and difficulties he said and advanced the policy for strengthening the diplomatic front under the prevailing situation. With comprehensive and deep analysis of the stern situation created on the Korean peninsula and complicated structure of the current international relations he set forth important tasks of taking offensive measures to reliably ensure the sovereignty and security of our state. He said that the U. S. labeled our state as its enemy ""axis of evil"" and ""target of its preemptive nuclear strike"" and applied the most brutal and inhuman sanctions against and posed the persistent nuclear threat to the latter over the past seven decades and the current situation on the Korean peninsula is getting more dangerous and reaching serious phase owing to the former's hostile policy towards the latter. In the past two years alone when the DPRK took preemptive and crucial measures of halting its nuclear test and ICBM test-fire and shutting down the nuclear-test ground for building confidence between the DPRK and the U. S. the U. S. far from responding to the former with appropriate measures conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop and threatened the former militarily through the shipment of ultra-modern warfare equipment into south Korea he said. The U. S. also took more than ten independent sanctions measures only to show before the world once again that it remained unchanged in its ambition to stifle the former he said. He stressed that under such condition there is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer the commitment to which there is no opposite party and this is chilling our efforts for worldwide nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Saying that the prevailing situation goes to prove that the road of defending ourselves by bolstering up our power sufficiently enough to keep the hostile forces at bay so that they would not dare provoke our sovereignty and security as already clarified by us is the one to be covered by us without any halt and hesitation he clarified the policy of the WPK towards the U. S. Noting that it is the WPK's firm goal of building national defence to possess the matchless military muscle and steadily bolster it he stressed that it is the core design in building defence power and firm will of the WPK to make any force dare not to use its armed force against us. Saying that we should more actively push forward the project for developing strategic weapons he confirmed that the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future declaring that we can not give up the security of our future just for the visible economic results and happiness and comfort in reality now that hostile acts and nuclear threat against us are increasing and nothing has changed between the days when we maintained the line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and now when we struggle to direct our efforts to the economic construction owing to the U. S. gangster-like acts. He solemnly declared that there is no need to hesitate with any expectation of the U. S. lift of sanctions even now that we had close look into the real intention of the U. S. adding if the U. S. persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U. S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built. He said that we will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U. S. and guaranteeing our long-term security noting that the scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the U. S. future attitude to the DPRK. He noted that our development of absolute weapons possessed by big powers is the great success but the big contingent of promising talents of science and technology in this course is more valuable result dear to the WPK. He said that the field of scientific researches for national defence and the field of munitions industry should implement the WPK's line of building national defence with loyalty and perfectly under the uplifted slogan of Higher and Faster in order to attain the already-set stage goals while maintaining the principle of self-reliance and Juche from A to Z. He called on the officials and scientists in the field of munitions industry to strive hard for the sacred activities for bolstering up national defence capabilities in every way with invariable loyalty to the Party and revolution in the spirit and mettle with which they developed the nuclear war deterrent through three-year arduous struggle. He tabled the issues of conducting an intensive party-wide nationwide and society-wide struggle against anti-socialist and non-socialist deeds and strengthening the work of the working people's organizations and tightening the moral discipline throughout society. He mentioned about the need to strengthen the Party the General Staff of the revolution and markedly raise its leadership role. He proposed principled matters and practical measures for further strengthening the Party organizationally and ideologically and heightening the role of cadres as required by the era and the developing revolution. Saying that our revolution is dynamically advancing but the hostile forces' challenge to it gets more persistent and current difficulties are never easy to deal with he stressed that the WPK decided to wage another arduous and prolonged struggle in order to win the final victory of the revolution and make our great people lead a good life. Saying that whether we will emerge victorious or not at the crossroads of the destiny of socialism only depends on the united might of the Party and its guiding role he stressed that the WPK will firmly keep standing to steadily deal serious strikes at the U. S. and its followers and always share joy and sorrow with our people. Saying that our people learned a way of self-sustenance way of defeating enemy and overcoming difficulties and way of defending their dignity and right in the prolonged and harsh environment unknown by history he clarified that it is our firm revolutionary faith to defend the country's dignity and defeat imperialism through self-prosperity even though we tighten our belts. Confirming that if we continue to make a dynamic struggle with the indomitable revolutionary faith ardent patriotism and indefatigable struggle spirit we will overcome every difficulty and greet the day of fresh victory when the song ""We Are the Happiest in the World"" becomes the real life of the whole people he ardently appealed to all to break through head-on the grave difficulty faced in the revolution and dynamically open a road of advance of victory to become a pioneer and standard-bearer in the current glorious struggle for realizing the aspiration and ideal of building a powerful socialist country.

75074,œFor the Rising Generations' Here Is Purpose of Revolution,It is an immutable truth taught by the Korean revolution that the revolution is in essence love for and devotion to the rising generations and the victory of socialism depends on the struggle for their wellbeing. The Korean people knew that the road of self-prosperity is difficult to follow but they have chosen it without hesitation and courageously withered all difficulties in order to provide the rising generations with firm foundation for their independent life and eternal prosperity. The road of socialism is the course of fierce class struggle and enemies get more frantic in their moves with the advance of the revolution. If the supreme interests of the country and nation are abandoned in the face of the raging adverse wind and difficulties nothing would have remained for the rising generations except noose of subordination and collapse of state. For over 7 decades the DPRK has undergone severe trials which others would not withstand even a month but advanced like the wind thanks to the preceding generations of the revolution that laid firm foundation for self-prosperity while tightening their belts for the present generation. The genuine love of the revolutionaries for coming generations is to train them as revolutionary talents prepared in terms of mentality morality technology culture and physical body. It is the intention of the Party that we should do everything possible for the rising generations to remain perfect even in the future. The revolutionary people working for bringing earlier the excellent future with warm love for the rising generations have nothing impossible.,Yu Chol,12/24/2019

S. State Department made reckless remarks against the DPRK that the U. S. remains concerned over ^human rights situation^ in the DPRK and it should ^engage to try to get a human rights violator like north Korea to change its behavior**^ etc. It is a revelation of the inveterate repugnancy towards our system and a grave political provocation against our state that the U. S. does confront us head-on** taking up the issue of human rights** not satisfied in raIloading an anti-DPRK ^human rights resolution^ at the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Such malicious words which came at this time when the DPRK-U.

75051,Reactionary Nature of Capitalism Viewed through Rights Issue of Women,The miserable situation of women's rights in the capitalist society is an inevitable result of the anti-popular system under which mammonism immorality and corruption and jungle law underlie the society. The reactionary politics is the root cause of all the misfortune and affliction women in the capitalist countries are suffering from. The Western politicians' extremely reactionary and anti-popular mindset and their method of government come to be the source of worsening social inequality and sexism the inveterate taints in capitalist countries. Many women have been reduced to commodities and victims to human traffic in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries women are difficult to get job and easy to be sacked. Family is a hell not the cradle of happiness for women in capitalist society defiant of morality and primary manners for human life. In capitalist countries women cannot but give up their right to maternity as they are subject to unemployment poverty and family violence.

Saying that Samjiyon County has been remodeled as the native one of the revolution and as the hub for practical experience and an immense edifice for the education in revolutionary traditions he noted that this is a manifestation of a rock-firm faith and immutable will of the Korean people to carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions the immortal foundation of the revolution as the eternal lifeline add everlasting luster to it and thoroughly implement the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on Paektu. He said that we should ensure that the Party members working people service personnel and youth and students of the new generation have a proper understanding of the revolutionary traditions of Paektu that they are the one and only traditions of the Korean revolution which were created along with the start of the Korean revolution and have been ceaselessly developed in every harsh period of the revolution. He continued that we should let them enshrine a proper viewpoint and attitude to the revolutionary traditions of Paektu that they have displayed undying vitality in the struggle of all stages and all forms of the Korean revolution and helped demonstrate the country's dignity and honor before the world. Now that the rising generations emerge as the main force new issues arise from the global political structure and social and class relations and the imperialists and class enemies make a more frantic attempt to undermine the ideological revolutionary and class positions of our Party we should always live and work in the offensive spirit of Paektu he pointed out. He stated that to firmly arm oneself with the great idea and spirit which run through the revolutionary traditions of Paektu is an important and vital issue of giving continuity to the generation of revolution. He remarked that it is an important goal and policy constantly maintained by the Party in training reserves for the revolution to make the new generations who make up the main force of the Korean revolution at present have the same ideological and spiritual qualities and fighting traits as those of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners adding that's why the Party made sure that the slogan ^Let us produce study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!^ are held aloft. Saying with deep emotion that he felt a lot while making the rounds of the revolutionary battle sites again and that there would be no one on a par with President Kim Il Sung who waged long bloody battles making his way through virgin snow for the sake of national liberation and the people's freedom and happiness he noted that the President's immortal revolutionary exploits will go down through generations along with the unchangeable imposing figure of Paektu. He reverently pictured the feelings of the President who must have surmounted lots of difficulties with a strong will dreaming of today's powerful socialist homeland he said stressing that he hardened his resolution to defend the gains of the revolution and take the one road only down through generations and that he felt encouraged though higher responsibility sits on his shoulders. Saying that the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung and Chairman Kim Jong Il pervades all the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary sites in the Mt Paektu area Kim Jong Un added that it is necessary to receive lots of education through the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in order to learn about the idea of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and the revolutionary idea and the indefatigable revolutionary spirit of our Party. It is particularly important for the commanding officials of the revolution to attend ^Paektusan University^ through the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in Mt Paektu in order to thoroughly prepare themselves to be sound and competent political activists who took after the great leaders he emphasized. It is the consistent determination and will of our Party to defend and carry forward for eternity the glorious revolutionary traditions which took roots in Mt Paektu and thus tide over the ordeals of the revolution and carve out the new road in the indomitable attack idea based on the great traditions he said setting out ways to conduct education in the revolutionary traditions of Mt Paektu among all the Party members and other working people and thoroughly embody them in all fabrics of social life. He called for organizing the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in winter too and stressed that it is the requirement of our Party that the study tour is not just carried out as a sight tour or sight-seeing in a formalistic way but is done in a substantial way to help the participants directly experience how harsh the ordeals and trials underwent by the anti-Japanese guerrillas were. He underscored the need to arouse once again the strong wind of arming with the revolutionary spirit through the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in Mt Paektu area in the entire Party. He called for taking measures to thoroughly reject and overcome such things as approaching the issue related to the study tour of revolutionary battle sites and the revolutionary sites as a business-like issue or a thing over which one can bargain as defaulting on it under the excuses of conditions as approaching the issue of education in the revolutionary traditions in a chronic way and as trying to substitute the reading session of the reminiscences of anti-Japanese guerrillas for it. He stressed the need for all the Party organizations to analyze and sum up in an overall way the education in the revolutionary traditions conducted in recent years and take strong substantial measures to do this important work in a consistent and intensive way. He said that the reason he spared his time to look round the revolutionary battle sites this time was to establish the social atmosphere of further strengthening the education in the revolutionary traditions. He continued that this is aimed to instill the indefatigable revolutionary spirit of Mt Paektu into the Party members and other working people soldiers of the KPA and youths and students in line with the present situation and environment of our revolution in which the entire Party and the whole army and all the people have turned out in the drive for building a powerful socialist country with the indomitable mental power of self-reliance by regarding the line for self-prosperity advanced by our Party as their lifeline despite the unprecedented blockade and pressure imposed by the imperialists and also in line with the needs to get prepared for the harshness and protracted character of our revolution. He stressed once again the need to defend and embody in all fields the revolutionary traditions of Mt Paektu the encyclopedia of our revolution and treasure of eternal value for the Korean nation. After looking round the revolutionary battle sites he once again ascended Mt Paektu the sacred mountain of the revolution.,Political News Team,12/4/2019

74876,Use of Armed Forces Is Not Privilege of U. S. Only: Chief of General Staff of Korean People's Army,Pyongyang** December 4 (KCNA) -- Pak Jong Chon** chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army** released the following statement on Wednesday:I heard that the U. S. president made undesirable remarks about the DPRK on Dec. 3 during the NATO summit in Britain. The Supreme Commander of our armed forces was also displeased to hear it. The DPRK and the U. S. are still technically at war and the state of truce can turn into an all-out armed conflict any moment even by any accidental case. Recently the armed forces of the U. S. have shown unusual military moves targeting the DPRK** and we are analyzing the effects those military actions can have on the security of the DPRK and are getting ourselves ready to cope with them. I think the only guarantee that deters physical conflict from flaring up in relations between the DPRK and the U. S. despite such a dangerous military stand-off is the close relations between the top leaders of the DPRK and the U. S. But recently the U. S. president said that he may use armed forces in clear reference to the DPRK** even though he attached preconditions. This greatly disappointed me. Such elated spirit and bluffing may greatly get on the nerve of the dialogue partner even at the slightest slip. One thing I would like to make clear is that the use of armed forces is not the privilege of the U. S. only. Anyone can guess with what action the DPRK will answer if the U. S. undertakes military actions against the DPRK. I clearly state here that if the U. S. uses any armed forces against the DPRK** we will also take prompt corresponding actions at any level. The use of armed forces against the DPRK will be a horrible thing for the U. S.,KCNA,12/4/2019

74880,Japan's Challenge to Current of Times and History Can't Be Tolerated: KCNA Commentary,Pyongyang** December 4 (KCNA) -- Many countries have made apology for and reflected on their wrongdoings of the past. This year Britain returned cultural relics to Ethiopia** Germany made an official apology for the slaughter of civilians by a Nazi unit in Italy and France recently returned cultural heritage which it plundered in Senegal in 19th century. This is an expression of the will of those countries not to commit the crimes again and a reflection of the international trend of promoting reconciliation and new development of relations among countries through the atonement for the past. There is such a shameless country as Japan which swims against the trend. Japan still refuses to admit** apologize for and make reparation for the monstrous crimes against the Korean people** other peoples of Asian countries and mankind. Japan's past history is a crime-woven history of aggression** war** plunder and massacre. In particular** Japan robbed Korea of its sovereign rights** a huge amount of natural resources and priceless cultural assets and destroyed them early in the last century. Its crimes are the worst ever known in history. Japan's plunder of cultural assets started before its occupation of Korea and came to a climax during 40-plus year-long colonial fascist rule. During the occupation of Korea** the Japanese imperialists took to Japan valuable historic relics which the Korean people created and preserved for thousands of years and destroyed what it couldn't carry away. They blew up the Mausoleum of King Kyonghyo (31st King of Koryo) in Kaesong and robbed relics equivalent to over 10 oxcarts. Displayed at the Ueno Museum in Tokyo are hundreds of cultural assets of Korea which Hirobumi Ito** the first resident-general of Korea** had taken to Japan. Displayed or kept at the Tokyo National Museum** big and small museums** universities and temples are cultural relics of Korea such as ceramic wares** metal handicrafts** mother-of-pearl handiworks** Buddhist statues** drawings** books and printing types. The number of the cultural relics of Korea added to those under private ownership is hundreds of thousands. The plunder of cultural assets of Korea by the Japanese imperialists is not mere property plunder by individuals but a hideous state-sponsored crime designed to obliterate the Korean nation by dint of the government power and military power and an unpardonable international crime contrary to international laws. Over 70 years have passed since Japan's defeat. But it has no an iota of consciousness over the mucky atrocities including plunder of cultural relics. It is totally denying and whitewashing them. Japan** not,KCNA,12/4/2019

74883,Past Crimes Committed by Japan to Hinder Modern Development of Korea,Pyongyang** December 4 (KCNA) -- On display at the Central Class Education House in Pyongyang** the capital city of the DPRK** are data on the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists to hinder the modern development of Korea in the past. The historical facts before and after the bourgeois reform in Korea in 1884 go to prove that the Japanese imperialists were cunning and vicious aggressors who resorted to all sorts of plots to hinder the development of Korea. An enlightenment group led by Kim Ok Gyun was formed in Korea in the early 1870s. The group set enlightenment** independence and building of a wealthy country with a powerful army as its political slogan. It was a progressive political force that desired the overthrow of the feudal conservative force and the modern development and independence of Korea. The enlightenment group staged the Kapsin Coup** the first bourgeois reform in Korea** on December 4** 1884. And it declared the birth of a new government on December 5** together with its political programme. In consideration of lack of its armed forces** the group got a ^promise^ from the then Japanese diplomatic minister to Korea that the Japanese troops would be mobilized to safeguard the royal palace at the time of coup. But the Japanese troops withdrew from the royal palace** breaking the ^promise^** when the situation took a sudden turn for the worse. So** the enlightenment group tried to use weapons it received from Japan as ^aid^** but they were all useless. After all** the group's attempt for enlightenment could not be realized and the Kapsin Coup ended within three days due to the Japanese imperialists' betrayal. The Korean people will never forget such criminal deeds done by Japan to hinder the modern development.,KCNA,12/4/2019

The detailed report said:The second-stage project for remodeling Samjiyon County has been successfully completed thanks to the Party's grand conception of construction and wise guidance and the revolutionary spirit of single-minded unity of the Korean people and their heroic struggle of self-reliance. Builders preserved the nationality** modernity and the specific feature of the northern tableland in the formation of the township division and construction and opened a new phase of practicality** diversity and the formative art by fully applying the Juche-based architectural aesthetic idea to the overall project. Thus they built the Township of Samjiyon County into an example of a mountainous modern town** an epitome of modern civilization and created a model of successfully realizing the Party's idea of local construction. The dramatic change witnessed in Samjiyon is a brilliant fruition of the Party's noble moral obligation and love for the people and a precious mental treasure born of the tremendous might of the single-mined unity and the spirit of self-reliance displayed by all the people of the DPRK who are creating socialist civilization to be proud of in the world with their own efforts and in their own way following the Party. Supreme Leader ''Kim Jong Un** who regarded it as one of due obligations and revolutionary duties of soldiers and disciples of Chairman ''Kim Jong Il to better his native county as befits the sacred place of the revolution** unfolded the far-reaching plan for sprucing up Samjiyon County when he visited it in November** Juche 102 (2013). The field-guidance to the county given by ''Kim Jong Un in December 2017 despite the bitter cold of winter served as a historic milestone in bringing about a great turn in the construction of the county and creating the standard and example of local construction.  ''Kim Jong Un paid special attention to every part of the blueprint of the county** setting out the issue of forming a modern street with a main road in front of ''Kim Jong Il's statue as the central axis** the issue of clearly dividing blocks of education** dwelling houses and local industry** the issue of adapting the buildings to their uses and avoiding similarity and replica while preserving the features of the mountainous county** and so on. The mock-up personally watched by ''Kim Jong Un numbered more than 8 800. So huge is the devotion and dedication made by him to lead the construction as the designer** key builder and key operator of the project.

New records were created ranging from the overall city layout to details of each structure** road facilities** visual agitation means including slogans and watchwords and electric light decoration. The greenery of the area was realized on a high level to suit the mountainous county in the Paektu area. This is the characteristics of the new look of the county. The shock brigade members of the 216 Division and the officers and men of the Korean People's Army** in hearty response to the appeal of the Party** turned out in the all-out charge to spruce up the Township of Samjiyon County. The project that required the construction of several-storey and multiple-storey apartment buildings for more than 4 000 families and over 380 blocks of public and industrial buildings in hundreds of hectares was gigantic creation drive tantamount to building a city. In just little over ten days** nearly 200 blocks of old buildings were removed and in tens of days** excavation for infrastructure projects was finished and from March 2018** the project for laying the groundwork for the apartment buildings and public structures went into a full swing. Great innovation drive pervaded all the construction sites in Paektu area. Self-built building materials production bases began to profusely pay off as there displayed the same spirit of self-reliance as was displayed in the forests of Mt Paektu. The movement of creating mass technical innovation swept across the Paektu area. Hundreds of technical innovations were invented and introduced when taking the Division as a whole** more than doubling the speed of construction thanks to the exceptional zeal shown by the builders. The radical change brought about in the Township of Samjiyon County is the brilliant result of the noble world of the loyalty of our people. The dedication of the people across the country to the sacred land of the great sun found its non-stop flow to the Paektu area. The strong desire and wish of the people to defend and glorify Samjiyon County which they regard as their own native places led to the increased production and transport and nationwide assistance. Thanks to the pure and clear loyalty displayed by the people** Samjiyon County towered as the excellent standard and ideal model of a mountainous city second to none in the world. The signal reality presented in the Township of Samjiyon County eloquently proves how noble and beautiful the goal of building a powerful socialist country of the Korean people** who are advancing along the straight road chosen by themselves without any vacillation despite the worst trials** is and how fast the struggle for realizing it is being advanced.,KCNA,12/3/2019

74816,KCNA Commentary Censures Japan for Rushing Headlong into Overseas Expansion,Pyongyang** December 1 (KCNA) -- Japan is still unabated in its military moves** disturbing the regional situation. Shortly ago** the Ministry of Defence announced that a joint actual maneuver between the U. S. marines and the Japan Ground ^Self-Defense Force^ would be staged in Shigoku in December for the first time. It was reported that four U. S. Ospreys would be involved in the maneuver. This is the clear manifestation of the military ambition of Japan getting frantic in its moves to become a military giant and launch an overseas expansion with the backing of its master as it is part of its moves to make the ^Self-Defense Forces^ take part in an actual war without fail. The current SDF which has turned into perfect armed forces with attack capability is very busy acquiring the capability for fighting a war** steadily expanding the sphere of its military operations and familiarizing itself with overseas expansion. What draws attention is that Japan is working hard to make the SDF acquire the capability for fighting a war under the pretext of the ^military alliance^ and ^cooperation for defence^. The SDF started the U. S. -Japan joint military exercises this year with an airlift drill simulating the defence of remote islands with a U. S. special unit. In collusion with its master** it continuously conducted military exercises akin to an actual war such as an actual maneuver between the ^amphibious task force^ and the U. S. marines and a joint exercise between fighters of the Japan Air SDF and a B-52 of the U. S. Air Force. In May** warships of the Japan Maritime SDF staged a joint drill with France** Australia and the U. S. in the Indian Ocean for the first time and hung around the waters off the Pacific for a long time for maritime joint exercises with littoral nations. In this context** the Japanese political circles are boosting the moves for laying a springboard favorable for military advance into other countries while approving the conclusion of agreements on mutual provision of goods and manpower between the SDF and the French and Canadian armies and examining the conclusion of the ^agreement on the status of visiting unit^ between the SDF and the British army. That's why the acts of the Japanese government pressing ahead with the dispatch of the SDF to the Middle East under the pretence of the aggravated Middle East situation can not be construed only from the viewpoint of ^information collection^ and ^assurance of marine security^. The horrible records of the SDF steadily enlarging the radius of its military operation throw doubts as to where the Japanese armed forces terminate their bid to acquire the capability for fighting a war. The largest defense costs in the history of Japan** armed forces with attack capability beyond the principle of ^exclusive defense^** military advance into other countries and other moves show that every military action of Japan is oriented to an actual war and reinvasion.

74811,Abe Ridiculed as Matchlessly Political Dwarf,Pyongyang** November 30 (KCNA) -- A vice director general of the Department of Japanese Affairs of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released the following statement on Saturday:He who is born a fool is never cured. The saying fits perfectly to Japanese Prime Minister Abe whose ignorance and stupidity were fully brought to light when he claimed the recent volley test-fire of the super-large multiple launch rocket system conducted by the DPRK is ballistic missile launch. Early in November Abe termed the test-fire of the super-large multiple launch rocket system conducted by the DPRK a ballistic missile launch at the ASEAN summit only to be denounced as an underwit who fails to distinguish a missile launch from multiple launch rocket system** and a rare-to-be-seen deformed child. He stills makes an ass of himself. On November 28 when the volley test-fire of the super-large multiple launch rocket system of the DPRK was conducted successfully amid great satisfaction** Abe convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council and claimed that it was a ballistic missile launch and grave challenge to the international community with no reason. Echoing Abe's claim** the chief cabinet secretary** the minister of defence** the foreign minister and other subordinates and media of Japan term the test-fire a ^ballistic missile launch^. This time the DPRK made a photo-illustrated report about the recent test-fire with a view to helping such fools as Abe see the projectiles with their eyes wide open. It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report which even civilians who have no knowledge of the ^military affairs^** to say nothing of soldiers** can know with a single glance. The whole world is unanimous in saying that the DPRK's recent test-fire is one of multiple launch rocket system** but Abe claims that multiple launch rocket system is missile launch to be ridiculed by the world people. The wretched sight of Abe makes us regard him as a dog seized with fear or a puppy fawning upon the master like the U. S. He seems to think that the U. S. will welcome his remarks about ^threat from the north^ at the juncture when the DPRK-U. S. negotiations are at a stalemate. The political dwarf's thought is very poor. It is quite natural that Abe is ridiculed as a puppy affected by mange as he fails to tell one thing from another and has plenty of cheek to turn black into white** being excluded from international politics. The DPRK considers it best not to deal with Abe as dealing with the most stupid person ever known in history and political dwarf out of favor brings disgrace to it. This thought of ours is hardening day by day. Worse still** it is the height of absurdity that Japan closest to the DPRK with the East Sea of Korea in between claimed that the multiple launch rocket system distinguished across the ocean is ballistic missile launch. It is uglier that Japan is making a fuss about ^a serious challenge to not only Japan but also the international community^** ^threat from the north^ and ^protest^ over the shell which did not drop in the waters off Japan. No one beat Abe** but evidently he is a thoughtless fool as he insists that he was beaten. There is a Korean saying that a fool makes a rod for himself. Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose. Abe would be well-advised to distinguish multiple launch rocket from a ballistic missile. Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf without parallel in the world. Pyongyang estimates such thing as Abe so much.,KCNA,11/30/2019

The open denial of the well-known crime is an impudent act intended to distort Japan's history of aggression and evade the settlement of its past. It is the unpardonable crime against humanity that Japan reduced women of several countries including 200 000 Korean women into sexual playthings** ruining their youth and infringing upon their rights. Human history records a lot of wars but knows no such a group of beasts as Japan which established the system of sexual slavery by exercising the state power and used women as a means for realizing its ambition to invade other countries while taking them to the battlefields by force. The sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army is** indeed** the most inhuman** immoral and brutal crime against humanity of all the war crimes committed by the island nation. Hundreds of thousands of female victims who were reduced into playthings of the Imperial Japanese Army were by no means those ^giving mental comfort to officers and men serving on the front^ but slaves who were deprived of their basic rights and right to existence** to say nothing of dignity as woman and human being. The Japanese imperialists not only violated women as they pleased** treating them nothing less than animals but also did not bother to commit such heinous crimes as shooting** burning** burying and killing them in group in every quarter to cover up the truth of their crimes. This is the truth of history which can never be buried. Despite the disclosure of the sexual slavery committed by Japan one by one by the testimonies made by the victims and records of history** Japan works hard to delete the parts related with its crimes from the textbooks and check the erection of statues of girl sexual slaves.

On November 5** south Korean President Moon Jae In politely sent to us a personal letter earnestly inviting the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission (SAC) of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to be present in the special summit.  There is no reason for us not to be grateful for it** if the personal letter contained the sincere trust in the SAC Chairman and invitation carrying earnest expectation.  We already know that the south side is looking forward to the visit by the SAC Chairman** with full preparations of the highest level including escort and ceremonies regarding his visit to Pusan.  We also fully understand the distress and agony of President Moon Jae In to hold on to the opportunity to make it a new occasion for Unaveling the present north-south relations.

We can not but think whether the present moment is a suitable time for the top leaders of the north and the south to meet.  From the reports being aired in the world** we know well enough that the sentiment pervading the land of the south is not clean.  The south Korean conservative forces have become zealous in their censure and attack on the DPRK** calling for ^scrapping of the north-south agreement^** not,KCNA,11/21/2019

74666,Japanese Imperialists Slammed for Fabricating 'œUlsa Five-point treaty',It has been 114 years since the Japanese imperialists fabricated the 'œUlsa Five-point Treaty' on November 17 1905. The 'œTreaty' was an illegal one devoid of legal validity. The Japanese imperialists pursued the heinous policy of obliterating the Korean nation on the 'œlegal basis' of the illegal 'œtreaty'. The policy enforced for over 40 years during their colonial rule over Korea was the most barbarous ever known in history. The Korean people had been subjected to the bloody slavery. The Japanese imperialists took the Korean young and middle-aged people to battlefields and slave labor sites. They made every desperate effort to deprive Koreans of their written and spoken language and even their surnames and names. And they did not hesitate to destroy and plunder at random the precious cultural wealth of the Korean nation and rich natural resources of Korea. The mental and material damage inflicted upon the Korean people by the Japanese imperialists was beyond imagination. The misfortune and pains the Korean people suffered during the Japanese imperialists aggressors' colonial rule remain a wrath uncured in their hearts though more than seven decades have passed since the country was liberated. The passage of time can neither reduce the crimes committed by the shameless aggressors who deprived the Korean nation of national sovereignty nor clear away the history of the Japanese imperialists who ran amuck to obliterate the Korean nation.,Ri Hyo Jin,11/19/2019

First Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un visited the August 25 Fishery Station a dear one which he affectionately calls the land of big fish haul and native home of fishing vessel Tanphung at all times. After visiting the newly-built fish-processing shop he made rounds of the already-built fish-processing shop and cold storages. He highly praised the efforts of officials fishermen and their families of the fishery station who work hard to make big fish hauls without fail this year too. He earnestly asked the officials to afford convenience in fishermen's everyday life and pay deep attention to the living of their families not stressing the production results. Looking round the room of the fishery station for the education in the revolutionary history he recollected with deep emotion the path of development that the station has covered for the past six years while upholding the banner of fishery revolution under the guidance of the Party. He said that it is necessary to effectively give the education through the room comprehensively showing the history of development of the station which has been developed into a core unit in implementing the Party's fishery policy so as to encourage its fishermen and employees to invariably and steadily glorify their honor of pioneer and shock brigade defending the WPK with big fish hauls as proud heroes who wrote the first page of the history of big fish hauls.

Watching the freezing and processing shops bristled with machines and equipment he said that they are full of fishes and machines and he seemed to see the sea of fishes and the sea of machines. And he learnt in detail about every fish-process stage and operation of equipment.

74671,Let Us Give Full Play to the Advantages of Socialism in All Fields,Today the Workers' Party of Korea calls upon all the sectors and units to work harder to give full play to the advantages of the Korean-style socialism. The people are regarded as the most valuable entity all the assets of the society are used for the promotion of people's wellbeing from A to Z and the society develops by dint of the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the popular masses. Herein lies the superiority of the Korean-style socialism over capitalism. To give full play to the advantages of the Korean-style socialism is a more pressing and important priority at present. Now the rising generations who have not been subjected to exploitation and oppression and are in lack of revolutionary tempering have emerged as the main force of the revolution. Under this situation if it is neglected to give full display to the advantages of socialism their faith in socialism wavers and illusion about capitalism grows among them. As a consequence they cannot devotedly work for defending and glorifying their ideology and system. The faith in socialism and indefatigable spirit can be consolidated as firm as a rock and fully displayed only when they keenly feel the advantages of socialist and popular policies through their real life while receiving strenuous ideological education. That is why the Party stresses the need to restore and fully display the advantages of socialism.,All the officials Party members and other working people should give the fullest play to the advantages and might of socialism under the leadership of the great Party so as to glorify the DPRK as the most powerful country and people's ideal society to be envied by the world. ,11/19/2019

74649,Securing Happiness for the People,Rectifying ShortcomingsOne January day in 2012 Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un found time to visit the Mirae Shop. He looked round it here and there and gave precious instructions on its good service. He dropped in at a show case of glasses which comprised various kinds of colored or powered ones. He picked up a pair of colored spectacles. His eyes clouded over. The officials did not see any reason for it despite their closely watching the glasses in the show case. He said to the officials that the show case was made to inconvenience of customers when they took out glasses and that it must be a rotary one which would enable them to choose their favorites with ease. He went the length of wearing the pair of colored spectacles. He asked a saleswoman where he could look at himself in a mirror. She was at a loss for an answer. She fetched him a mirror from a luxury counter. He told the officials that he did not want to use it but that a spectacles counter must have a mirror for customers to be able to look at their faces in it after they put on any of glasses. They had so far flattered themselves that the store had nothing to be desired. But Kim Jong Un gave the first consideration to the convenience of the people and pointed out the shortcomings of service activities in a moment. The officials realized more keenly than ever from what standpoint and with what attitude they should serve the people.  Tasting NoodlesKim Jong Un visited the newly built Pyongyang Corn Processing Factory one day in August 2015. He inspected the integrated production process relief chart of the factory and acquainted himself with its production capacity. He asked its official how its corn noodles tasted. That moment he recalled what had happened one year ago. Informed that the citizens of Pyongyang were served with delicious and peculiar corn noodles in a restaurant Kim Jong Un tasted them in person spoke highly of them and taught in detail how to cook them more daintily than usual. The official told him that the current products of his factory tasted exactly as good as the noodles sampled by him that time. Kim Jong Un said that the noodles tasted all right. The material for them and their garnishing too were the same as those for the ordinary citizens of Pyongyang. This is another story of his warm love for the people.,Ko Chol Myong,11/17/2019
74640,Mt Kumgang Is Not Common Property of North and South,Leaves of trees on Piro Peak seem to turn further golden and waves in Sea Kumgang to make greater swashes at the grandiose measure taken by the Central Committee of our Party to demolish without trace the south side's facilities that sprawled out only to mar the beautiful scenery of the famous mountain and to turn it into the people's resort envied by the whole world and modern international tourist resort of our style. But the south side has behaved awkwardly from the beginning as regards our new project for the development of Mt Kumgang tourist area. On October 25 the relevant institution of our side in reflection of the firm will of the Central Committee of our Party sent to the Unification Ministry and the Hyundai Asan Co. Ltd of south Korea a message asking them to send us a plan for the withdrawal of the south side's facilities in Mt Kumgang area and corresponding schedules and to make an earlier agreement by way of exchanging documents. The south Korean authorities responded with senseless words like ^initiative method^ and ^proposal of technical talks^. As it seemed that they did not understand clearly what we asked we on October 29 and November 6 again notified them of our fixed intention. We made clear our stand in mother tongue but the south Korean authorities pretended ignorance uttering ^in-depth discussion^ and ^necessity of visit by a joint inspection team^. The south Korean authorities left the facilities for the tour of Mt Kumgang untouched for over a decade in fear of the U. S. Only after they are pressed with the withdrawal of those facilities they are dismayed begging us to let them stay even at a corner of the mountain and take part in the resumption of the tour. How can they be called pitiful or shameful?Provided that the timetable is set we can not while away time only exchanging messages. Therefore on November 11 we sent an ultimatum warning that if the south Korean authorities persist in their useless assertion we will take it as an abandonment of the withdrawal and take resolute measure for unilaterally pulling down the facilities. However they have remained answerless until today. When we gave enough time and opportunities enduring huge losses on our side and when we showed the magnanimity out of compatriotic feelings of allowing the resumption of the tour of Mt Kumgang without any precondition and in return for nothing they remained retracted while reading this face and that face. Now they are faced a bolt from the blue. It's like raising an axe to bring it down on its own feet. Being steeped in the sense of flunkeyism to the marrow of their bones they not coming to their senses even at this crucial moment when the fate of their facilities is like a light before the wind went to the U. S. to make an entreaty letting loose senseless utterances that ^the issue of tour of Mt Kumgang should be handled in the DPRK-U. S. negotiations^ and ^substantial discussion of the tour can be possible only when progress is made in the negotiations for the denuclearization^. But their master only remained cold. By origin the issue of the development of Mt Kumgang tourist area is never an issue to be interfered in by the south Korean authorities and they have already disqualified from doing so. To make it clear again Mt Kumgang is our land where our sovereignty is exercised and our noted mountain where even a tree and a cliff is associated with our sovereignty and dignity. The diamond mountain the best in the world which all the world people want to see saying ^See Mt Kumgang and then die^ is clearly neither the common property of the north and the south nor the place symbolic of north-south reconciliation and cooperation. We will develop Mt Kumgang to be the world renowned tourist resort with responsibility and in our own way as its owner for the sake of the nation and posterity. There is no room for south Korea to find its place there.,Rodong Sinmun,11/16/2019

Kim Jong Un listened to him carefully.

The officials could not but reflect on their past work then and there. They had so far worked in many units to modernize them but had never determined a success or a failure in their work judging from what their workers wanted and how much they liked. But Kim Jong Un has always given top priority to the demand and interests of the people. Learning this view of the people the officials fully understood the true meaning of our Party's modernization.  The Best Name Kim Jong Un worked heart and soul with all devotion to build the Rungna Island into a super center for the cultural and emotional lives of the people true to the instructions of Chairman Kim Jong Il. One April day a few years ago he visited the construction site of the Rungna People's Recreation Park which was near completion. It blew so hard that the construction site was full of dust. In spite of this Kim Jong Un looked round many places of the construction site for a long time. That day Kim Jong Un said that in his opinion another general name must be given to the Rungna Island but that the word 'œpeople' must not at all be excluded from the name. He warmly added that it was most advisable to call the island the Rungna People's Pleasure Park to honor the lifelong devotion of President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il to the people. The officials were convinced once again that the word 'œpeople' was deeply cherished in the heart of Kim Jong Un.  Don't Begrudge Investments One Sunday in May 2016 Kim Jong Un visited the Medical Oxygen Factory under construction. Looking round the construction site he said with great satisfaction that the factory had already shown its appearance and earnestly suggested to the officials that the factory be built into the sole one of the world. Presently he gave detailed advices on the management of the factory. He said that investments in health should not be begrudged for the people to benefit from medical service better than ever under the socialist health system and adopted benevolent measures to build modern medical oxygen producers like the factory in many parts of the country. As for the instructions of Kim Jong Un on unlimited investments in the medical service of the people he is quite ready to pick stars from the sky and grow flowers even on stones to make the people happy.,Kang Won Nam,11/8/2019

74538,Choe Ryong Hae Makes Speech at 18th NAM Summit,Choe Ryong Hae member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) first vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly who is leading a delegation of the DPRK made a speech at the 18th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is a powerful independent force against imperialism a peace-loving force against war he said and went on:The NAM has played a significant role in achieving independence and progress of the developing countries and safeguarding global peace and security. The present international situation bears a resemblance to the early days of Cold War between the East and the West when the NAM was born. Now is the time when the NAM Member States should turn out in the resolute fight for building a peaceful and prosperous world an independent and just world braving through the challenges with concerted efforts. Now the situation on the Korean peninsula is at a critical crossroad of either moving towards durable peace along with the trend of dÃ©tente or facing again a touch-and-go crisis. A year has passed since the adoption of June 12 DPRK-U. S. Joint Statement. But the DPRK-U. S. relations see no improvement and the situation on the Korean peninsula is still caught up in the vicious cycle of escalated tension. This is ascribable to the U. S. pursuit of its anachronistic policy hostile to the DPRK and its continued political and military provocations. Comrade Kim Jong Un chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK stated in his historic policy speech in April that there is a need for the U. S. to quit its current method of calculation and approach us with a new one. We believe that preventing war and achieving durable peace on the Korean peninsula fully accord with the ideals of the NAM and it will also contribute to safeguarding global peace and security. In view of its mission and ideals the NAM is a group for international justice and it is a force that has potential to realize international justice. We take that a most pressing task now for the NAM is to struggle for realizing a genuine international justice. If international justice is not realized the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter will be reduced to a blank sheet of paper and worse still the sovereignty and the right to existence of small countries and NAM member states will never be guaranteed. The countries which value justice should build on their strength on the principle of self-reliance and self-development and bring earlier a new independent and just world by uniting and cooperating with each other under the banner of anti-imperialism and independence. Along with the political unity the NAM Member States should develop South-South cooperation by strengthening exchange and collaboration by regions and continents on the principles of equality mutual benefits and complementing one another. In the face of ever-increasing sanctions and pressure of the hostile forces to deprive our Republic of its sovereignty and right to development the people of the DPRK are making dynamic efforts to build a powerful socialist country by dint of self-reliance and self-development. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will discharge its responsibility and role as a member state of NAM to invariably maintain the purity and ideals of the Movement further develop the friendly and cooperative relations with its member states and strengthen and develop the Movement.,Rodong Sinmun,10/30/2019

The Japanese authorities** opening to the public on Oct. 18 a video showing our vessel sinking** talked nonsense that ^while our patrol ship was sailing frontward** the north Korean vessel turned the helm to the left^ and ^we took an appropriate measure to control illicit operation. ^This is none other than a trick to evade the responsibility for sinking the vessel by ascribing the incident to so-called ^illicit fishing operation^ and ^mistake in controlling vessel. ^The fishing vessel incident obviously is nothing but a deliberate barbarity as it is a vivid expression of the Japanese authorities' insane hostile policy toward the DPRK. The chief executive of Japan at the full-dress session of the House of Councilors on Oct. 8 said that an illegal fishing operation by the north Korean vessel was not confirmed.

The statement said that Abe regime committed a heinous crime against humanity in which it excluded kindergartens of Korean schools from the ^program for free education and upbringing of children^ for the mere reason that the kindergartens of Korean schools teach Korean not Japanese. It went on:The Japanese reactionaries' recent atrocious act the extension of their hostile policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) clearly shows their vicious prejudice and discrimination against Koreans in Japan. The Democratic Lawyers Association of Korea strongly denounces the heinous discrimination by the Japanese authorities recklessly trampling down the right of the Korean children in Japan to study and their valuable dream as a grave provocation against the DPRK and Chongryon and an open challenge to international law. If the Japanese authorities persist in discriminating and oppressing the children of Koreans in Japan failing to face up to the trend of the times they will certainly meet the severe revenge of the Korean people and stern judgment by history. The Japanese authorities should seriously reflect on their brutal and illegal state crime ruthlessly trampling down the national right and dignity of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and leaving a scar in the minds of Korean children and unconditionally roll back their measure without delay.,Rodong Sinmun,10/24/2019
