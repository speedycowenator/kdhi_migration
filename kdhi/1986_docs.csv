Diplomatic Relations of Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea,diplomatic-relations-of-republic-of-korea-and-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea,Report by USIS on Human Rights in ROK for 1984,Bureau of Intelligence and Research: U.S. Department of State,"<h1>Diplomatic Relations of Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea</h1><h2>Summary</h2><p>There have been several changes in the diplomatic relations of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Â·and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea(DPRK) in the past 2 l/2 years, &nbsp;the most notable of which occurred in the wake of the DPRK 1st bomb attack against President Chun's delegation visiting Rangoon in October 1983. As a result, the ROK continued to widen its margin over the DPRK in their diplomatic competition for increased international recognition and prestige, Changes since 1982 include:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four countries (Burma, Comoros, Costa Rica, and Western Samoa) broke relations with the DPRK as a result of the Rangoon bombing and now maintain relations only with the ROK.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three additional countries--Ireland (in 1983), St.Christopher-Nevis (in 1983), and Brunei (in 1984) -- recognized the ROK exclusively.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other countries -- Guinea-Bissau (in 1984) and Pakistan (in 1983) --which had recognized only the PPRK, established relations with the ROK.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malawi, which had recognized only the ROK, established relations with the DPRK in 1982.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesotho â€œsuspendedâ€ its relations with the ROK in 19S3.

Spence Richardson in the State Department told me the other day that Kim Dae Jung and the Korean government were both still busily painting themselves into opposite corners over the question of Kim's proposed return to Korea. The State Department believes that Kim's earlier intention had been to work out a deal with the Korean government whereby the latter would amend its passport to enable him to travel to Europe, where he would meet Brandt, Palme etc and that he would return to Korea after the National Assembly elections. However, the Korean government appeared to have backed out of this deal, giving as one reason a speech made by Kim recently in New York in which he had questioned Chun's legitimacy. The State Department understood that Kim now planned to return to Korea around the end of this month. A number of eminent Americans including Congressman&nbsp;Barney Frank, former Ambassador to Soul Robert White, and former Assistant Secretary for Human Rights in the Carter Administration, were saying they planned to accompany him to Seoul. </p><p>2. Richardson said that the Korean government were still maintaining their hard line that Kim's sentence still had 17 years to run. The Koreans new very well that if they put him back in jail the United States would have to express strong regret./ Kim for his part probably calculated that the United States' interest in human rights had pulled his chestnuts out of the fire in the past,. and that they would be bound to intervene again. Richardson concluded rather ruefully that their early hopes of sticking to the line that this was not a matter for the U.S. government had proved unrealistic, and that he had no confidence that the Korean government would so handle the matter as to aoid new frictions bewtween the two governments. </p><p><em>Signed: S J Gomersall</em></p>",United States,PENDING,PENDING

This involves in each case an in-depth reviÂ§..w of the intelligenceÂ· for the past year preparation of a summary paper describing the nuclear program of the country concerned and identifying the key issues involved, followed by an.analysis and recommendations concerning future U.S. policy options. In each case, we have a free-wheeling discussion among appropriate NWC staff (it is strictly an .internal exercise), and eventually we wind up with a summary report, the first of which follows below for your information. (We have combined North and South Korea because they are so closely interrelated.)</p><p>BACKGROUND</p><p>The Korean Peninsula is a region of tension with strong U.S. non-proliferation concerns and economic interests. South Korea has a sense of insecurity regarding the North for good reasons. The conflict between the North and South has a history ranging from full-blown war during the early 19SO's to a controlled dialogue at present. Over the past decade, however, there has been a massive conventional military buildup by the North, and this buildup is continuing.</p><p>South Korea is a party to the NPT and has all of its nuclear program under IAEA safeguards. North Korea is not party to the NPT. While some foreign-supplied facilities in North KOrea are under IAEA safeguards, indigenous facilities are not. </p><p>North Korea has undertaken several major nuclear projects.[REDACTED]...safeguarded nuclear facilities in a region of tension are always a concern to us. Regardless of the nature of the North Korean nuclear program, the ROKG will perceive this effort as a threat to South Korean national security. This perception can, in turn, bring internal pressures within the ROKG to reconsider a nuclear weapons option.</p><p>South Korea does not now have a nuclear weapons program. </p><p>[REDACTED}</p><p>U.S. OBJECTIVES</p><p>The USG has two overriding nuclear-related objectives in this region. First, we want to prevent both North and South Korea- from moving to a nuclear weapons program, Secondly, we want to maintain long-term stable nuclear cooperation with South Korea.
